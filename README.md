# Online Bookstore Management System - University Project

This repository contains the Online Bookstore Management System, a term project for the Advanced Programming course at [Your University Name]. This project is designed to demonstrate the practical application of object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism within a Python-based application.

## Project Overview

The Online Bookstore Management System allows users to manage an inventory of products (books, magazines, DVDs), process orders, and generate sales reports. It simulates a real-world bookstore system but is simplified for educational purposes.

## Learning Objectives

- To understand and apply Python classes and objects in a real-world application.
- To implement core object-oriented programming concepts:
  - **Inheritance**: Extending base classes to create a more specific class hierarchy.
  - **Encapsulation**: Using private and public access modifiers to protect and encapsulate object data.
  - **Polymorphism**: Utilizing Python's method overriding within class hierarchies.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Add, update, search, and remove items from the inventory.
- **Order Processing**: Create orders, add items to orders, calculate totals, and finalize orders.
- **Sales Tracking**: Generate and view reports detailing sales and order history.
