## Advanced Programming Course Project Online Bookstore Management System 
In this application, students will develop a simplified online bookstore management 
system using mainly object-oriented programming principles with a focus on 
inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and method overloading. 
### Project Tasks: 
1. Implement the classes using Python's object-oriented programming features, 
including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding. 
2. Define appropriate attributes and methods for each class, ensuring that 
subclasses inherit common attributes and methods from the superclass.
3. Add suitable methods to improve the work of the system. 
4. Test the implementaƟon by creating instances of `Book`, `Magazine`, and `DVD` 
classes, adding them to the bookstore inventory, and performing operations like 
updating item details and retrieving item information.
7. Enhance the applicaƟon by adding features like searching for items by title, 
author, or genre, managing customer orders, and calculating total sales.
